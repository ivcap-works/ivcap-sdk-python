# 'ivcap_client' Docs

This directory containse a s very simplistic setup to create
documentation of the various library functions and data models
using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

Before creating the docs, ensure that all the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt` are installed.

After that `make html` should build an HTML version of the docs
in [./_build/html](./_build/html/index.html).
